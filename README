bruteforce-wallet
=================

The purpose of this program is to try to find the password of an encrypted
Peercoin (or Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc...) wallet file (i.e.: wallet.dat).

The program tries to decrypt one of the encrypted addresses in the wallet by
trying all the possible passwords.
The minimum and maximum password length to try can be indicated as option
on the command line.
The beginning and the end of the password can be specified too.
There are also options to indicate the character set and number of threads
to use.

Sending a USR1 signal to a running bruteforce-wallet process makes it print
progress info to standard error and continue.


## Dependencies

The program requires the OpenSSL and BerkeleyDB libraries.


## Limitations

Different versions of BerkeleyDB are usually not compatible with each other.
Therefore, for the program to work, you will have to check that the BerkeleyDB
version you are using can read the databases created by the BerkeleyDB version
your wallet was created with.


## Examples

Try to find the password of an encrypted wallet file using 4 threads, trying
only passwords with 5 characters:

    bruteforce-wallet -t 4 -l 5 -m 5 wallet.dat


Try to find the password of an encrypted wallet file using 8 threads, trying
only passwords with 5 to 10 characters beginning with "W4l" and ending with "z":

    bruteforce-wallet -t 8 -l 5 -m 10 -b "W4l" -e "z" wallet.dat
