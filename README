bruteforce-salted-openssl
=========================

The purpose of this program is to try to decrypt a file that was encrypted
with openssl (e.g.: openssl enc -aes256 -salt -in input.file -out output.file).

The program tries to decrypt the file by trying all the possible passwords.
The minimum and maximum password length to try can be indicated as option
on the command line.
There are also options to indicate the cipher, digest, character set and
number of threads to use.

The program should be able to use all the digests and symmetric ciphers
available with the OpenSSL libraries installed on your system.


Dependencies:
-------------

The program requires the OpenSSL libraries.


Examples:
---------

Try to decrypt a aes256 encrypted file using 4 threads, trying 
only passwords with 5 characters:

  bruteforce-salted-openssl -t 4 -l 5 -m 5 -c aes256 encrypted.file


Show the list of available algorithms:

  bruteforce-salted-openssl -a
