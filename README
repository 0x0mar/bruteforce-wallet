bruteforce-wallet
=================

The purpose of this program is to try to find the password of an encrypted
Peercoin (or Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc...) wallet file (i.e.: wallet.dat).

The program tries to decrypt one of the encrypted addresses in the wallet by
trying all the possible passwords.
The minimum and maximum password length to try can be indicated as option
on the command line.
There are also options to indicate the character set and number of threads
to use.


## Dependencies

The program requires the OpenSSL and BerkeleyDB libraries.


## Limitations

Different versions of BerkeleyDB are usually not compatible with each other.
Therefore, for the program to work, you will have to check that the BerkeleyDB
version you are using can read the databases created by the BerkeleyDB version
your wallet was created with.


## Example

Try to find the password of an encrypted wallet file using 4 threads, trying
only passwords with 5 characters:

    bruteforce-wallet -t 4 -l 5 -m 5 wallet.dat
